        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb with multiple health benefits.
            It can reduce anxiety and stress, help fight depression, boost fertility and
             testosterone in men, and even boost brain function.
            Supplementing with ashwagandha may be an easy and effective way to improve your health
             and quality of life.
            It’s classified as an adaptogen, meaning that it can help your body manage stress.
            Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda,
             a form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing.
            Ashwagandha has been shown to increase muscle mass, 
            reduce body fat, and increase strength .
            In a 60-day study in chronically stressed adults, the group taking the highest dosage of standardized ashwagandha extract
             experienced a 17% decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol and an 11% decrease in triglycerides,
             on average .

               Rich in potassium, these fruits help reduce hypertension or high blood pressure. 
               Potassium helps lower the content of sodium in our body, 
               which is one of the main causes of an increased level of high blood pressure.
               Other than potassium, it also consists of high amount of calcium,
                which is good for our bones. Lack of calcium can result in severe bone disorders 
               like osteoporosis,
